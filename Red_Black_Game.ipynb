So I searched online and found this site <ADD SITE LINK> which has the mathematical explanation of the correct method. So now I'm going to code up that solution and show you!\n",

    "You're given a standard 52 card deck, placed faced down.\n",
    "You take a random subset of X of those cards, and you know that there are Y blacks in your hand.\n",
    "You pick up cards one at a time:\n",
    "- If the card was **BLACK** you win $1\n",
    "- If the card was **RED** you lose $1\n",

    "1) Calculate the expected value of the game, given your current score and the remaining cards\n",
